# Sequential_Yoga_Pose_Assessment_for_Self_Training

A deep learning based approach for sequential assessment of Surya Namaskar yoga poses. 

Methods utilised for developing the GUI for self training:
1) 2D pose estimation
2) 3D pose estimation
3) Pose classification using K-Nearest Neighbours
4) Featuring a timer to keep track of pose duration and sequences
5) Developig indicators to show wrong limb positions (Geometry-based pose analysis)

For a detailed overview of the methods, network architecure used, pose classifier model used, logic behind pose comparison and feedback comments kindly refer to this [report]().
